The project focuses on working with UDP for high-performance applications, understanding the implications of a malicious intermediary, exploring RPC through a proxy design for communication abstraction, and distributing a standalone neural network application, providing foundational knowledge for distributed systems.

Summary: 

1. Work with User Datagram Protocol (UDP):
   - Understand UDP's usage in internet applications like DNS, DHCP, video, and audio traffic.
   - Utilize UDP for high-performance scenarios where occasional packet loss is acceptable.

2. Explore the implications of a malicious intermediary:
   - Analyze the potential risks and challenges posed by malicious actors intercepting communication.

3. Understand Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) abstraction:
   - Implement RPCs using a proxy design to abstract communication code and separate it from application logic.
   - Recognize RPC's significance in distributed systems, spanning four decades of use.

4. Learn to distribute standalone applications:
   - Distribute a simple neural network application, providing a foundational understanding for distributed systems.
   - Acknowledge the application's potential as a starting point for further exploration into neural networks.
